## The Open Runtime for AI Agents

> üí° **Runtime and ecosystem for AI agents.**
> Discover and run community agents built with frameworks like LangChain, all on your infrastructure.

AgentSystems is a self-hosted platform for deploying AI agents from an emerging decentralized ecosystem. Deploy agents on your laptop, home server, cloud infrastructure, or air-gapped networks. Built around container isolation, federated discovery, and provider abstraction.

- üåê **Federated Agent Ecosystem** - Git-based agent index using GitHub forks, no central gatekeepers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Container Isolation & Network Controls** - Sandboxed execution with egress filtering for running third-party agents
- üîå **Provider Portability** - Agents integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama‚Äîswitch via configuration
- üè† **Your Infrastructure** - Deploy agents on your infrastructure with configurable execution controls

Compatible with major AI providers and local models. Single-command install for macOS/Linux.

```

## Why AgentSystems

**The problem:** Teams want to use specialized AI agents (codebase migration, research synthesis, visual content analysis, structured data extraction) but face a dilemma:

- üîí **SaaS agents** require sending sensitive data to third parties
- üõ†Ô∏è **Building from scratch** takes weeks of development per agent (most teams lack ML expertise)
- üê≥ **Manual Docker orchestration** means configuring networks, volumes, proxies, and API keys for each agent (time-consuming, error-prone)

**AgentSystems solves this** by providing a standardized runtime and ecosystem:

- **For teams without infrastructure expertise:** One command deploys everything (networking, isolation, audit logging)
- **For compliance-focused organizations:** Run agents on-premises or air-gapped with configurable egress controls
- **For developers building products:** Browse community agents instead of building from scratch
- **For enterprises:** Discover, evaluate, and deploy agents with container isolation and audit logging

### Federated Agent Ecosystem

AgentSystems uses a Git-based agent index where:
- Developers publish agents via GitHub forks
- Anyone can run their own agent index alongside the AgentSystems community index
- No central authority controls listing or distribution
- Uses GitHub's fork and authentication mechanisms for attribution

**Why this matters:** Agent developers can publish once and reach users who self-host, while organizations can create private indexes with company-approved agents.

### Container Isolation & Network Controls

Each agent runs in its own Docker container with:
- Configurable network egress filtering (HTTP proxy with allowlists)
- Thread-scoped artifact storage (isolated per-request file access)
- Hash-chained audit logs with cryptographic integrity verification
- Lazy startup and automatic resource management

### Provider Portability

Agents built with the AgentSystems toolkit use a `get_model()` abstraction that routes to configured providers:
- Switch from OpenAI to Anthropic to Ollama through configuration
- Run the same agent with different models and providers
- Reduce vendor lock-in at the agent level

## How It Works

```

**Architecture Highlights:**

1. **Federated Discovery** - Pull agents from decentralized Git-based indexes
2. **Runtime Injection** - Your credentials and model connections injected at runtime into agent containers
3. **Container Isolation** - Each agent runs in its own Docker container with separate namespaces
4. **Default-Deny Egress** - Configurable network filtering with allowlist-based controls
5. **Thread-Scoped Storage** - Isolated artifact storage per request
6. **Hash-Chained Audit Logs** - Cryptographic integrity verification for operation tracking

## Who Should Use This?

**Good fit:** Teams without dedicated infrastructure engineers, startups prototyping quickly, organizations requiring on-premises deployment, agent developers seeking distribution.

**Might not need this:** Teams with existing container orchestration and DevOps resources managing agent infrastructure.

## Comparison to Other Tools

**vs. LangChain/CrewAI:** AgentSystems runs agents built with frameworks ‚Äî it doesn't replace them. Think Docker for Node.js apps.

**vs. Portkey/LiteLLM:** Different layers. AI gateways route API calls; AgentSystems runs complete applications with workflows and file I/O.

**vs. Manual Docker:** You can build this yourself. AgentSystems is the pre-built, standardized version.
