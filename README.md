## Self-Hosted Platform for AI Agents

> üí° **Self-hosted platform for discovering and running AI agents.**
> Deploy specialized agents on your infrastructure‚Äîwithout building from scratch or using SaaS.

AgentSystems is a standardized runtime for third-party AI agents. Deploy on your laptop, home server, or air-gapped network. Built with container isolation, federated discovery, and provider abstraction.

**Key Features:**
- üåê **Federated Agent Ecosystem** - Git-based index, no gatekeepers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Container Isolation** - Separate containers with egress filtering
- üîå **Provider Portability** - Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- üè† **Your Infrastructure** - Deploy on your own servers

Compatible with major AI providers and local models. Single-command install for macOS/Linux.

## Quick Start

**One-command install** (macOS/Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/agentsystems/agentsystems/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

This installs:
- `agentsystems` CLI
- Docker (if not present)
- Required dependencies

**Next steps:**
```bash
agentsystems init agentsystems-platform && cd agentsystems-platform
agentsystems up
open http://localhost:3001  # Web UI
```

## Why AgentSystems

**The problem:** Teams want to use specialized AI agents (codebase migration, research synthesis, visual content analysis, structured data extraction) but face a dilemma:

- üîí **SaaS agents** require sending data to third parties
- üõ†Ô∏è **Building from scratch** takes weeks of development per agent (most teams lack ML expertise)
- üê≥ **Manual Docker orchestration** means configuring networks, volumes, proxies, and API keys for each agent (time-consuming, error-prone)

**AgentSystems provides** a standardized runtime and ecosystem:

- **For teams without infrastructure expertise:** Single command deployment (networking, isolation, audit logging)
- **For compliance-focused organizations:** Run agents on-premises or air-gapped with configurable egress controls
- **For developers building products:** Browse community agents instead of building from scratch
- **For enterprises:** Discover, evaluate, and deploy agents with container isolation and audit logging

### Federated Agent Ecosystem

AgentSystems uses a Git-based agent index where:
- Developers publish agents via GitHub forks
- Anyone can run their own agent index alongside the AgentSystems community index
- No central authority controls listing or distribution
- Uses GitHub's fork and authentication mechanisms for attribution

**Why this matters:** Agent developers can publish once and reach users who self-host, while organizations can create private indexes with company-approved agents.

### Container Isolation & Network Controls

Each agent runs in its own Docker container with:
- Configurable network egress filtering (HTTP proxy with allowlists)
- Thread-scoped artifact storage (per-request file directories)
- Hash-chained audit logs for tamper detection
- Lazy startup and automatic resource management

### Provider Portability

Agents built with the AgentSystems toolkit use a `get_model()` abstraction that routes to configured providers:
- Switch from OpenAI to Anthropic to Ollama through configuration
- Run the same agent with different models and providers
- Reduce vendor lock-in at the agent level

## Available Agents

Browse community agents at [agentsystems.github.io/agent-index](https://agentsystems.github.io/agent-index/)

The agent index is a federated, Git-based registry where developers can publish agents and users can discover them. Agents are organized by developer namespace and include metadata about capabilities, model requirements, and usage examples.

*Don't see what you need?* [Build your own agent](https://docs.agentsystems.ai/deploy-agents/quickstart) and publish it to the index.

## How It Works

```

**Architecture Highlights:**

1. **Federated Discovery** - Pull agents from decentralized Git-based indexes
2. **Runtime Injection** - Your credentials and model connections injected at runtime into agent containers
3. **Container Isolation** - Each agent runs in its own Docker container with separate namespaces
4. **Default-Deny Egress** - Configurable network filtering with allowlist-based controls
5. **Thread-Scoped Storage** - Separate artifact directories per request
6. **Hash-Chained Audit Logs** - Tamper detection for operation tracking

## Who Should Use This?

**‚úÖ Good fit:**
- Teams without dedicated infrastructure engineers
- Startups prototyping AI products quickly
- Organizations requiring on-premises or air-gapped deployment
- Agent developers seeking distribution channels
- Teams needing audit trails

**‚ùå Might not need this:**
- Teams with existing container orchestration and dedicated DevOps resources
- Single-agent deployments where manual Docker setup is sufficient
- Organizations comfortable with SaaS agent providers

## Comparison to Other Tools

**vs. LangChain/CrewAI:** AgentSystems is a runtime for agents built with these frameworks. Your agent code uses LangChain; AgentSystems deploys and runs it.

**vs. Portkey/LiteLLM:** Different layers. AI gateways route API calls; AgentSystems runs complete applications with workflows and file I/O.

**vs. Manual Docker:** You can build this yourself. AgentSystems is the pre-built, standardized version.

## Platform Components

The platform consists of 6 interdependent repositories:

**For most users:** You only interact with `agentsystems-sdk` (CLI) and `agentsystems-ui` (web interface).

**For agent developers:** Use `agent-template` and `agentsystems-toolkit` to build, then publish to `agent-index`.
