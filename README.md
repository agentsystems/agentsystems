## The Open Runtime for AI Agents

**Run third-party AI agents on infrastructure you control.**

AgentSystems is a self-hosted platform for deploying AI agents from an emerging decentralized ecosystem. Deploy agents on your laptop, home server, cloud infrastructure, or air-gapped networks. Built around container isolation, federated discovery, and provider abstraction.

- üåê **Federated Agent Ecosystem** - Git-based agent index using GitHub forks, no central gatekeepers
- üõ°Ô∏è **Designed with a Zero-Trust Approach** - Container isolation + egress control for running third-party agents
- üîå **Provider Portability** - Agents integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama‚Äîwrite once, run anywhere
- üè† **Your Infrastructure** - Control over where your data goes and how agents execute

Compatible with major AI providers and local models. Single-command install for macOS/Linux.

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/agentsystems/agentsystems/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

## Why AgentSystems

The platform addresses a fundamental challenge: how do you benefit from specialized AI agents without sending your data to third-party services or building everything from scratch?

**Traditional approaches:**
- Send your data to AI services (lose control)
- Build custom agents from scratch (time-consuming, complex)

**The AgentSystems approach:**
- Run third-party agents in your environment
- Access a federated ecosystem of specialized agents
- Maintain control over data and infrastructure

### Federated Agent Ecosystem

AgentSystems uses a Git-based agent index where:
- Developers publish agents via GitHub forks
- Anyone can operate their own agent index alongside community indexes
- No central authority controls listing or distribution
- Uses GitHub's fork and authentication mechanisms for attribution

This creates a decentralized ecosystem where agent developers can share or commercialize their work while operators maintain infrastructure control.

### Designed with a Zero-Trust Approach

Each agent runs in its own Docker container with:
- Configurable network egress filtering (HTTP proxy with allowlists)
- Thread-scoped artifact storage (isolated per-request file access)
- Hash-chained audit logs for tamper-evident operation tracking
- Lazy startup and automatic resource management

### Provider Portability

Agents built with the AgentSystems toolkit use a `get_model()` abstraction that routes to configured providers:
- Switch from OpenAI to Anthropic to Ollama through configuration
- Run the same agent with different models and providers
- Reduce vendor lock-in at the agent level

This is the "write once, run anywhere" moment for AI agents.

## How It Works

**Architecture Highlights:**

1. **Federated Discovery** - Pull agents from decentralized Git-based indexes
2. **Runtime Injection** - Your credentials and model connections injected at runtime into agent containers
3. **Container Isolation** - Each agent runs in its own Docker container with separate namespaces
4. **Default-Deny Egress** - Configurable network filtering with allowlist-based controls
5. **Thread-Scoped Storage** - Isolated artifact storage per request
6. **Tamper-Evident Logging** - Hash-chained audit logs for operation tracking
