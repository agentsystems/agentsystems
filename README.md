## Why AgentSystems

**The problem:** Teams want to use specialized AI agents (codebase migration, research synthesis, visual content analysis, structured data extraction) but face a dilemma:

- üîí **SaaS agents** require sending data to third parties
- üõ†Ô∏è **Building from scratch** takes weeks of development per agent (most teams lack ML expertise)
- üê≥ **Manual Docker orchestration** means configuring networks, volumes, proxies, and API keys for each agent (time-consuming, error-prone)

**AgentSystems provides** a standardized runtime and ecosystem:

- **For teams without infrastructure expertise:** Single command deployment (networking, separation, audit logging)
- **For organizations requiring on-premises deployment:** Run agents on-premises or air-gapped with configurable egress controls
- **For developers building products:** Browse community agents instead of building from scratch
- **For enterprises:** Discover, evaluate, and deploy agents with container isolation and audit logging

### Federated Agent Ecosystem

AgentSystems uses a Git-based agent index where:
- Developers publish agents via GitHub forks
- Anyone can run their own agent index alongside the AgentSystems community index
- No central authority controls listing or distribution
- Uses GitHub's fork and authentication mechanisms for attribution

**Why this matters:** Agent developers can publish once and reach users who self-host, while organizations can create private indexes with company-approved agents.

### Container Isolation & Network Controls

Each agent runs in its own Docker container with:
- Configurable network egress filtering (HTTP proxy with allowlists)
- Thread-scoped artifact storage (per-request file directories)
- Hash-chained audit logs
- Lazy startup and automatic resource management

### Provider Portability

Agents built with the AgentSystems toolkit use a `get_model()` abstraction that routes to configured providers:
- Switch from OpenAI to Anthropic to Ollama through configuration
- Run the same agent with different models and providers
- Reduce vendor lock-in at the agent level

### For Agent Developers

Some customers won't use your agent if it means sending data to your servers. AgentSystems gives you a distribution channel for those customers.

**How it works:**
- Build your agent once using standard frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, etc.)
- Publish to the agent index
- Customers who need self-hosting can discover and deploy your agent on their infrastructure

Your agent runs on their infrastructure. You never touch their data. You focus on agent capabilities, they handle their own deployment.

## Available Agents

Browse community agents at [agentsystems.github.io/agent-index](https://agentsystems.github.io/agent-index/)

The agent index is a federated, Git-based registry where developers can publish agents and users can discover them. Agents are organized by developer namespace and include metadata about capabilities, model requirements, and usage examples.

*Don't see what you need?* [Build your own agent](https://docs.agentsystems.ai/deploy-agents/quickstart) and publish it to the index.

## How It Works

```

**Architecture Highlights:**

1. **Federated Discovery** - Pull agents from decentralized Git-based indexes
2. **Runtime Injection** - Your credentials and model connections injected at runtime into agent containers
3. **Container Isolation** - Each agent runs in its own Docker container with separate namespaces
4. **Default-Deny Egress** - Configurable network filtering with allowlist-based controls
5. **Thread-Scoped Storage** - Separate artifact directories per request
6. **Hash-Chained Audit Logs**

## Who Should Use This?

**‚úÖ Good fit:**
- Teams without dedicated infrastructure engineers
- Startups prototyping AI products quickly
- Organizations requiring on-premises or air-gapped deployment
- Agent developers who need customer-controlled deployment options
- Agent developers building agents that handle customer data
- Teams needing audit trails

**‚ùå Might not need this:**
- Teams with existing container orchestration and dedicated DevOps resources
- Single-agent deployments where manual Docker setup is sufficient
- Organizations comfortable with SaaS agent providers

## Comparison to Other Tools

**vs. LangChain/CrewAI:** AgentSystems is a runtime for agents built with these frameworks. Your agent code uses LangChain; AgentSystems deploys and runs it.

**vs. Portkey/LiteLLM:** Different layers. AI gateways route API calls; AgentSystems runs complete applications with workflows and file I/O.

**vs. Manual Docker:** You can build this yourself. AgentSystems is the pre-built, standardized version.

### vs. Manual Docker Orchestration

| Task | Manual Approach | AgentSystems |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Discover agents** | Search Docker Hub, read docs | Browse agent-index, see metadata |
| **Install agent** | Write compose file, configure networking | `agentsystems up` from config |
| **Model routing** | Hard-code API keys per agent | Shared `agentsystems-config.yml` |
| **Network isolation** | Configure Squid/iptables manually | Pre-configured egress proxy |
| **File uploads** | Design artifact system, mount volumes | Thread-scoped `/artifacts/{id}/` |
| **Audit trail** | Build logging yourself | Hash-chained logs included |
| **Publish agent** | Push to Docker Hub, write docs | PR to agent-index |

**Bottom line:** You *can* build this with Docker + Squid + bash scripts. AgentSystems is those scripts, pre-built and standardized for the agent use case.

| **[agent-index](https://github.com/agentsystems/agent-index)** | Federated agent discovery | GitHub Pages | rolling |

**For most users:** You only interact with `agentsystems-sdk` (CLI) and `agentsystems-ui` (web interface).

**For agent developers:** Use `agent-template` and `agentsystems-toolkit` to build, then publish to `agent-index`.

## Platform Capabilities

### Security & Isolation Features
- Docker container isolation with separate namespaces per agent
- Network egress filtering via HTTP CONNECT proxy
- Configurable URL allowlists per agent
- Hash-chained audit logging
- Thread-scoped artifact storage (per-request file directories)

### Agent Management
- Agent discovery via Docker labels
- Lazy container startup on first request
- Configurable idle timeouts and resource limits
- Multi-registry authentication (Docker Hub, Harbor, ECR, self-hosted)
- Agent lifecycle management and version switching

### Developer Experience
- Simple FastAPI contract for building agents
- Model provider abstraction (`get_model()` for LangChain, etc.)
- Built-in file upload/download handling
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Complete reference implementation with LangGraph

### Agentic Workflow Orchestration

Build specialized agents that work together instead of monolithic agents that do everything.

**How it works:**
- Agents invoke other agents via the gateway API to create multi-step workflows
- Thread-scoped storage (`/artifacts/{thread-id}/`) enables data passing between steps
- Each agent focuses on one task and produces deliverables for downstream agents

**Example workflow:**
1. **Classification Agent** receives document ‚Üí identifies document type ‚Üí writes result to thread storage
2. **Extraction Agent** reads classification ‚Üí applies specialized extraction logic ‚Üí writes structured data
3. **Validation Agent** reads extracted data ‚Üí checks for errors/inconsistencies ‚Üí writes validated output
4. **Report Generator** reads validated data ‚Üí produces final deliverable

**Why this matters:** Instead of building one complex agent that handles classification + extraction + validation + reporting, build four focused agents that can be reused across different workflows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I run my own private agent index?**
A: Yes. The agent index is Git-based and federated. You can run your own index alongside the public one, or use only private indexes.

**Q: What happens when AgentSystems releases updates?**
A: You control when to upgrade. There are no forced updates.

**Q: Can agents call other agents to create workflows?**
A: Yes. Agents can invoke other agents via the gateway API. Thread-scoped storage enables passing data between workflow steps.

**Q: Do I need to modify my existing LangChain/LangGraph agents?**
A: Minimal changes. Wrap your agent logic in a FastAPI app with `/invoke`, `/health`, and `/metadata` endpoints. See the [agent template](https://github.com/agentsystems/agent-template) for the pattern.
