## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in AgentSystems, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**security@agentsystems.ai**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., container escape, data exposure, denial of service, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of coordinated disclosure. We request that you give us reasonable time to address the issue before making any information public.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.
